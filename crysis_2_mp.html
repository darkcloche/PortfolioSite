		<h1>5th Avenue</h1>	
		
        <h3>
		
		After transferring to the UK studio, I was tasked with converting some of the singleplayer maps into DLC maps for the Crysis 2 multiplayer. The first of these was 
		the Bryant Park level (known as "Train To Catch" in singleplayer), situated in front of the public library behind Bryant Park in NYC. In order to condense the level relative to it's much more open
		singleplayer sister map, we opted for building out an art gallery in the centre of the level that contained the shortest but tightest routes across the map, with the rest of the level
		flowing in a circle around it via the roads and alleyways that populated the area in front of the library.
		
		<br />	
		<br />
		
		The end result had a lot of strong elements - the verticality around the art gallery allowed for a good amount of nanosuit usage for players attacking and defending the building, and the 
		level art came together really well to give the opposing corners of the map distinct themes. There were a few issues I'd like to address areas if given a chance to address the level again - for example, 
		the main street that runs across the front of the library ended up being too flat, lacking many line of sight blockers or interesting level elements
		for players to utilise the core traversal mechanics around. Overall though, I was pleased with the result, particularly given the time we had.
		I also managed to squeeze in a bit of personal scripting fun when building out the missile stations that shot down alien dropships as part of the ambience in the level - they served
		as mid height vantage points for players looking to play a slower more methodical game, and also punctuated the silence of smaller matches with the targeted destructions of dropships
		providing consistent background events.

		<h1>Prism</h1>	
		
        <h3>
		
		Prism was adapted from one of the later action bubbles situated on Roosevelt Island towards the end of the singleplayer campaign, and provides a view of the Queensboro bridge
		heading towards a night-time Manhattan as a backdrop for the tight, vertical combat around the raised helipad in the middle of the map. One of the smaller levels in the DLC packs, 
		there was initially concern that it'd be too dense to adequately support the player count, but early playtests showed that the reduced size upped the pace and intensity of the combat encounters
		without compromising player spawn locations or route choice too much.
		
		<br />	
		<br />
		
		I was particularly pleased with how Prism turned out - the large amount of vertical gameplay options around the helipad combined with the tight circular flow created a lot of
		frenetic encounters with players using the traversal based routes to their advantage. The objective based game modes (Capture The Relay in particular) were especially enjoyable, as precarious 
		routes created by the alien tentacles offered faster capture times but were especially exposed. 
		
		<br />
