		<h1><b>Semper Fi or Die (Madison Square)</b></h1>
		<h3>
		The 10th of 19 missions in the game, Semper Fi or Die
		is set in the aftermath of a tidal wave that swept through New York after the events of the previous mission. It was the first level in 
		the game that showed the surface of the city in a state of 
		<a href="http://www.accesoxbox.com/img/fotos/1108/foto_4.jpg" target="_blank">total disarray</a>, 
		and as such allowed us to be far more experimental with the assets
		compared to the levels that preceded it. Verticality, natural cover and level boundaries were much easier to contextualise with "an earthquake happened here". 
		
		<br />	
		<br />	

		It was also the first level after the intro to feature the US marines, giving the player their first taste of friendlies in combat situations. 
		They added more interest to the encounters, were a useful tool for us to lead the player, and offered 
		camaraderie and chuckles -  "Nice suit man, that 5th Avenue? You been shopping without me?".
		
		<br />	
		<br />	
		
		One of the great strengths of Crysis 2 in my mind is the design of the campaign as a whole, with no environment or gameplay styles
		sticking around long enough to cause much fatigue with the level design (which I think it manages despite a ~10 hour playtime). The fresh 
		flooded NYC setting combined with new AI combinations made Semper Fi or Die 
		a good example of the ways the game stayed interesting to players, and was a great first level for me to cut my teeth on as a junior level designer with the Frankfurt team.

		<h1>Driving Section (AB2)</h1>	
		
        <h3>
		
		This section of the level was originally an extension of the previous action bubble. The player was able
		to commandeer a hovercraft that had been stranded on the collapsed highway, drive down some rapids amidst 
		alien dropship attacks, and arrive at the final action bubble. Unfortunately, the hovercraft was cut from the game,
		meaning the section was essentially cut along with it.
		
		<br />	
		<br />
		
		However, I had always liked the change of pace that it offered, and thought there was scope to do something interesting with the environment and 
		assets we already had. During a research afternoon, I blocked out an armoured car
		based driving section (complete with ramps and squishy stuff to run over) 
		set atop a vast collapsed section of city. I wanted to do something striking with the level of the environmental destruction - I felt
		there was an opportunity to sell the transformation New York had gone through on a more epic scale. It was reviewed, 
		well received, and made into the game that week as Action Bubble 2.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		Despite the relatively short duration of the sequence, I'm happy that it became part of the level - it's a welcome breather after the intense
		close quarters combat beforehand, and players responded well to being allowed to 
		floor it through a portion of the game that catered to driving with reckless and cinematic abandon.
		We also added enough cover around the enemies, 
		explorables to find, and foot traversal routes so that if players destroyed or elected to not use the vehicle, the 
		section wasn't especially punishing (if a bit sparse).
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		FUN "OVERLY AMBITIOUS" ORIGINS FACT: The crumbling road event at the end of this section (if you do it in a vehicle) was originally a short cinematic I blocked out where the player character jumped
		out of the driver's seat, spun in mid air to see the jeep careen into an alien dropship that was flying past, and then land on his feet on the other side of the crevasse. 
		A man can dream.

		<h1>Dropship Combat (AB3)</h1>	
		
        <h3>
		
		We wanted to use the new backdrop of the flooded city to introduce the more mobile alien reinforcement methods.
		The increased verticality gave more opportunities
		for both them and the player to utilise traversal abilities to gain an advantage in combat, and the lower density of high rise buildings in the play area compared to 
		the start of the game gave dropships more space to operate. As such, the final action bubble of the level 
		was intended to be the showcase piece for the dropships, with the larger scale, sweeping terrain and verticality offering 
		some more player driven objectives. 
		
		<br />	
		<br />
		
		Unfortunately during development the size of the area had to be cut down and the narrative of the marines took more of a front seat,
		both of which meant this didn't quite take shape in the end. I'd have liked to experiment with multiple
		goals that were less scripting-driven in this section,
		but the end result turned out fun as well. There's lots of potential for physics + explosives interplay, and new weapon unlocks combined with the gunship fight 
		helped give the action bubble some fresh tools and situations to add interest to the hold out objective. We also managed to keep larger elements like the beached
		cargo ship which helped give the area identity and offered more vertical options to the player.
		
		<br />	
		<br />
		
		FUN "OVERLY AMBITIOUS" ORIGINS FACT: The very end of the level was, at one time, a pseudo-cutscene where the only way to progress
		through a gap in some train wreckage was to slide, which would then put you in a un-interruptible super slide 100m down 
		the <a href="images/work/screenshot_crysis_2_sp_madison_ab3_3.png" target="_blank">collapsed railway track</a> towards a ramp that flung you over a ravine 
		into the back of the Staten Island ferry. I like to think the final descent into the sewer wished it could be this at heart.

	<h1><b>A Walk In The Park (Central Park)</b></h1>
	<h3>The last level of the game being set atop an elevated alien infested Central Park was an awesome concept for the game's finale. The initial design (owned by other 
	members of the design team) was of a more open section of the park that comprised the bulk of the level, with some creative final boss ideas prototyped throughout early production.
	However, as design resources left or moved into different roles it was unfortunately left until very late into the project
	to be picked up again. Along with a few other designers, I was moved onto resurrecting it with just over a month until alpha. This
	required rebuilding the level from scratch to bring it back in line with the achievable scale whilst also trying to create a final level that would do the game justice.
	
	<br />
	<br />
	
	Despite the extremely tight deadline and inability to create anything requiring a lot of 
	new work from code, art or animation, it was a really rewarding time working on the Central Park action bubbles. I moved into the "Level Pit" (the room where the level du jour was focused on by 
	the AI and design team) and worked with the excellent <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/pub/sven-fahrenwald/2b/37b/771" target="_blank">Sven Fahrenwald</a>
	to create the action bubbles that made up the last objectives of the game. We also had the really really excellent Lead Level Designer <a href="http://www.narby.net" target="_blank">Chris Auty</a>
	who worked alongside to give feedback as well as get in the editor himself and work on  
	the particularly problematic areas of the level. Working with the more senior designers taught me a lot about
	scripting cleanly and efficiently, and there were some really valuable takeaways 
	from how the AI logic of the level was constructed to cater cleanly to multiple playstyles.

		<h1>Bandshell (AB1)</h1>	
		
        <h3>
		
		
		The <a href="http://centralpark.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/bandshell.jpg" target="_blank">Bandshell</a> was one of the two real life Central Park locations we had 
		available for the game and as such became the main landmark to theme the first action bubble around (despite having to cut its singular exploration-friendly back room
		interior for copyright reasons). This first gameplay area and the lead-up to it served to give a sense of the 
		fragility and total destruction that had been caused by the alien spear - working alongside the cinematics 
		team we were able to achieve lots of ambient destruction sequences to give a bit more life to the fiction of the alien transformation of the park.
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		In retrospect, I think the Bandshell action bubble had a few failings. The lack of objective local to the area meant players were able to stealth/sprint past the alien setup if they
		weren't interested in pickups or collectibles, and the terrain was relatively flat and open which meant after the initial vantage point players were left a little starved of safe areas
		to observe and combat from.	However, I was still pleased with the options available for more observant players - mounted guns, flanking routes and the entire game's arsenal of weapons
		at the player's disposal meant that there were lots of fun options available for taking on the brunt of the alien frontline.

		<h1>Stalker Boss (AB3)</h1>	
		
        <h3>
		
		Lacking a proper final encounter design when starting the Central Park rebuild, it came down to seeing how we could generate ways of using existing tech to offer
		a different kind of gameplay experience for the last action bubble of the game. It was decided
		that we could take the stalker enemy type (one of the more interesting aliens as it had
		a wide range of traversal abilities to dodge the player) and apply the cloak shader to it any time it wasn't attacking. This meant that the behaviour prior to its attacks was masked by invisibility,
		encouraging the player to use tools like thermal vision coupled with awareness of footstep sounds and effects to locate and combat the stalkers.
		Although not an impressive large scale high-stakes boss akin to the Crysis 1 ending encounter, I feel like the challenge was suitably different and 
		the environment claustrophobic enough to offer an enjoyable battle to round off the level.

	followed by being able to instantly dive in and make the required changes was really effective - it avoided people getting burnt out churning on the same space repeatedly,

	one manually into an AI action that designers could call on AI entities within the level.
