		<ul>
			<li>
			Prior to the game transitioning from a more traditional FPS campaign structure to open world development, 
			I was responsible for taking multiple singleplayer levels from pre-production to "hardening" phase. 
			This involved working closely with the narrative and art teams to establish locations, story beats and layouts, 
			and then working with the art team to build out a basic playable version of the level for review and iteration. 
			I was then also responsible for further developing "exotic" gameplay that featured in these levels, prototyping and iterating on 
			multiple mechanics and sequences that would help make each level feel unique whilst adhering to the core gameplay design.
			</li><br/>
			
			<li>
			After a stretch of development in the new open world format, I felt the Red Zone portion of the game's open world wasn't delivering the experience it had the potential to offer.
			I identified a number of design and art issues in the existing implementation of the zone, and requested to spend a week of my time on a Red Zone pre-visualisation to set a vision benchmark for the zone.
			This was approved, and the resulting pre-vis was used as a basis for a renewed direction of Red Zone. I then led a small team from all departments to implement this direction in the game. 
			I talked about this process at the Game Design Across Genres talk at EGX Rezzed 2015 - the presentation and accompanying videos can be found <a href="personal_egx.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
			A video from GamesCom 2015 showing this area can be seen below.

			During the course of the game's development, I was responsible for producing and owning elements of elements for all internal vertical slices, public demos
			proof of concepts and key prototype deliverables in order to drive them to the desired quality level. A notable public example of this would be the E3 2014 gameplay shown below - for this
			I was tasked with scripting the demo flow, leading a multi-disciplined team to polish this to the required quality, and capturing the final footage used in the press video.

		<ul>						
			<li>
			Throughout the design team's production of content for the game, I reviewed scripting content from the other
			team members as much as possible in order to make sure that event setup was kept clean, optimal and well organised. I also 
			worked to produce pre-fabricated setups for various repeatable open world systems that minimised setup time required by designers implementing the content.
			</li><br/>
			
			<li>
			On top of my own workload, I spent time pushing for tools side workflow improvements throughout production. 
			This included frequent collaboration with the tools team to design new features to smooth the transition to open world as well as investigate and debugging tools issue. On top of this, I learnt Python 
			in my own time in order to build functionalities that helped designers automate repetitive editor tasks that were frequent timesinks in day to day work.
