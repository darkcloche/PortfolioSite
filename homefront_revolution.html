			I was tasked with owning the E3 demo gameplay deliverable, shown at E3 2014 (visible below).
			This involved scripting the representative slice of the open world co-op experience visible in the 
			demo and working together with other departments to achieve final quality. I took this from concept 
			stage to final video capture over the course of 3 months.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			With a personal aim to inject more "guerrilla warfare" into the core interaction and mechanics of the game,
			I was given a small team comprising of design, code and animation for a few months before an internal milestone to kickstart 
			development of new features and improvements that would achieve this goal. Some of the results of this that now feature in the game 
			include an improved first person cover system, blind fire and suppression - this is visible in the E3 demo gameplay.

			<li>
			Prior to the game transitioning from a more traditional FPS campaign structure to open world development, 
			I was responsible for taking multiple singleplayer levels from pre-production to "hardening" phase. 
			This involved working closely with the narrative and art teams to establish locations, story beats and layouts, 
			and then working with the level artist to build out a basic but playable version of the level for review. 
			Beyond this, the levels were then worked on by art and myself to establish a more detailed start to end flow, 
			with all gameplay beats and bespoke events built out.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			During the course of the game's development, I was given ownership of elements for every internal CXP, vertical slice,
			proof of concept and key prototype deliverable. This involved personally taking the levels involved from concept to final quality, 
			as well as working with other departments to achieve the desired quality from both the level design and core gameplay.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			After the transition to open world, I was responsible for design, implementation and maintenance of a 
			number of core open world objective types, one of which (the police station) has a condensed version briefly taken on in the E3 demo.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			Throughout the design team's production of content for the game, I reviewed scripting content from the other
			team members as much as possible in order to make sure that event setup was kept clean, optimal and well organised. I also 
			worked to produce prefabricated setups for various gameplay related world objects that minimised manual implementation required by designers during setup.
			</li>
			
			<li>
			As well as completing my own tasks, I took it upon myself to push for tools side workflow improvements throughout production. 
			This included frequent liason with the tools team to create and prioritise tasks, as well as learning scripting languages 
			in my own time in order to build functionalities in Python that helped designers automate repetitive editor tasks.
			</li>
